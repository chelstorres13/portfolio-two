  <h2 class="green-header"> Welcome! I'm Chelsea </h2>
  <p> I'm a Software Developer based in Kansas City, MO. I'm currently studying full-stack web development at Thinkful. </p>
  <p> I have a diverse educational background including a Bachelor's degree in Interdisciplinary Studies and a minor in Education. Transitioning into software development was an easy choice for me because I love to be constantly learning. </p>

     <h2> About Me </h2>
     <div class="group">
     <div class="item">
     <p> I love web development because I enjoy solving complex problems and forcing myself to dig deeper when answers aren't readily available. It's refreshing to have a job where new challenges await you everyday. </p>
     </div>
     <div class="item">
     <p> I look forward to beginning a career where I get to work along side other developers who come from all backgrounds. I enjoy gaining perspective from others through collaboration as well as sharing knowledge when my expertise is needed. </p>
     </div>
     <div class="item">
     <p> Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my family, reading by a well-lit window, creating digital art, and trying out new recipes in the kitchen. </p>
     </div>
     <div class="item">
     <p> So far my Software Development toolkit includes Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I'll be learning much more in the coming months and aim to provide full-stack web development services to clients. </p>
